## Features

### **1. Speech Assessment**
#### **Audio Transcription**
- Users can upload audio files through a React-based client application.
- The `Flask` server leverages `OpenAIâ€™s Whisper` machine learning model for high-accuracy speech-to-text transcription.

#### **Similarity Analysis**
- Transcribed text is compared to a predefined target text (e.g., speeches or learning material) using `Google's Generative AI`.
- The platform calculates a similarity score and provides detailed insights into alignment with the target text.

#### **Results and Feedback**
- Performance analysis highlights areas of strength and improvement.
- Results are stored for further review, enabling continuous learning and progress tracking.
