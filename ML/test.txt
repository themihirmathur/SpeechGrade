english:
Our environment is made up of both natural and man-made elements. Natural elements include the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land we live on. Man-made elements include buildings, roads, and other structures. Our environment is important to us because it provides us with the resources we need to survive, such as food, water, and shelter. It also provides us with a place to live, work, and play.
